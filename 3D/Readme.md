# 3D Translation and Scaling

## Overview

This project demonstrates fundamental operations in 3D computer graphics: **Translation** and **Scaling**. These transformations are crucial in manipulating objects within a 3D space, allowing changes in position and size while preserving shape and orientation. 

The project includes:

- Implementation of translation and scaling algorithms.
- Visualization of the transformations applied to 3D objects.
- Analysis of the effects of transformations on object coordinates.

## Algorithms

### 1. **3D Translation**

Translation in 3D involves moving an object from one location to another without altering its size, shape, or orientation.

#### Mathematical Representation:
Given a point \(P(x, y, z)\) and a translation vector \(T(tx, ty, tz)\), the new point \(P'(x', y', z')\) after translation is:

\[
x' = x + tx
\]
\[
y' = y + ty
\]
\[
z' = z + tz
\]

#### Steps:
1. Define the 3D object coordinates.
2. Specify the translation vector.
3. Add the respective translation values to each coordinate of the object.
4. Output the new coordinates.

### 2. **3D Scaling**

Scaling alters the size of an object in the 3D space. Uniform scaling changes the size uniformly across all axes, while non-uniform scaling allows different scaling factors for each axis.

#### Mathematical Representation:
Given a point \(P(x, y, z)\) and scaling factors \(S(sx, sy, sz)\), the new point \(P'(x', y', z')\) after scaling is:

\[
x' = x \cdot sx
\]
\[
y' = y \cdot sy
\]
\[
z' = z \cdot sz
\]

#### Steps:
1. Define the 3D object coordinates.
2. Specify the scaling factors for each axis.
3. Multiply each coordinate of the object by its corresponding scaling factor.
4. Output the new coordinates.

## Implementation

### Tools and Libraries
- **Programming Language**: Python (or any other language of your choice).
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib (for Python) or Three.js (for web-based visualization).

### Example Usage
```python
# Python example for translation
object_points = [(1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 6), (7, 8, 9)]
translation_vector = (3, -2, 5)

translated_points = translate_3d(object_points, translation_vector)
print(translated_points)
```

## Conclusion

This project highlights the importance of 3D transformations in graphics and simulations. By understanding and implementing these fundamental operations, users can control object positioning and scaling, forming a basis for more complex transformations like rotations and reflections. 

These concepts are essential in fields like computer graphics, game development, virtual reality, and simulations.

### Future Scope
- Extend the project to include **3D Rotation** and **Shearing**.
- Integrate with a graphical interface for interactive transformations.
- Implement transformation pipelines for rendering scenes.
