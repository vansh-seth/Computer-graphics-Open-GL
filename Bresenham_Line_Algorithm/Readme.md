# Bresenham Line Algorithm with OpenGL

This project demonstrates the Bresenham line drawing algorithm using OpenGL and GLUT. It draws a line between two points on a 2D plane based on user input.

## Overview

The Bresenham line algorithm is an efficient way to determine which points in a grid-based system should be plotted to form a straight line between two given points. This project uses OpenGL to visualize the algorithm by drawing the line in a graphical window.

## Requirements

- OpenGL
- GLUT (OpenGL Utility Toolkit)
- A C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang++)

## Compilation and Execution

1. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure that you have OpenGL and GLUT installed on your system. On a Debian-based system, you can install them using:
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install freeglut3-dev
    ```

2. **Compile the Program**:
    ```bash
    g++ -o bresenham_line bresenham_line.cpp -lGL -lGLU -lglut
    ```

3. **Run the Program**:
    ```bash
    ./bresenham_line
    ```

4. **Input**: When prompted, enter the coordinates for the start and end points of the line in the following order: `x y x2 y2`. For example:
    ```
    Enter the values in the order x, y, x2, y2
    10 20 100 200
    ```

## How It Works

1. **Initialization**:
   - `init()` sets up the OpenGL environment, including the clear color and orthographic projection.

2. **Bresenham Line Algorithm**:
   - `bresenham_line(int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2)` computes the points along a straight line between `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` using integer arithmetic for efficiency.
   - The algorithm calculates the difference in x (`dx`) and y (`dy`), as well as the step direction (`sx` and `sy`). It then iterates through the points to determine which ones should be drawn.

3. **Rendering**:
   - `bresenham_spoke()` clears the color buffer and draws the line using `bresenham_line()`. The line is drawn in blue with a point size of 2.

4. **Launcher**:
   - `launcher(int argc, char** argv)` initializes GLUT, sets the display mode, creates a window, and starts the main loop.

## Example

To draw a line from `(10, 20)` to `(100, 200)`, input:
```
10 20 100 200
```

A window will open displaying the line based on the provided coordinates.
