# Liang-Barsky Line Clipping Algorithm

## Overview

This project implements the **Liang-Barsky Line Clipping Algorithm** using **OpenGL** and C++. The algorithm clips a line segment against a rectangular clipping window. It is more efficient than the Cohen-Sutherland algorithm because it uses parametric equations to find the intersection points, resulting in fewer computations.

### Features:
- Input: A predefined line segment and a rectangular clipping window.
- Clipping the line based on the boundaries of the clipping window.
- Displays the original and clipped line upon pressing the `c` key.

## Algorithm Steps

1. **Initialize**:  
   The OpenGL environment is set up with the orthographic projection to create the 2D space where the line clipping will occur.

2. **Define the Parameters**:
   - The line is represented parametrically with endpoints `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`.
   - The four edges of the clipping window are defined by `xmin`, `ymin`, `xmax`, and `ymax`.

3. **Calculate Differences**:
   - Calculate the differences `dx = x2 - x1` and `dy = y2 - y1` for the line's direction.
   
4. **Set up P and Q Arrays**:
   - `p[]` stores the direction of the line with respect to each clipping boundary (negative for left/bottom edges, positive for right/top edges).
   - `q[]` stores the difference between the line's position and the clipping boundaries.
   
5. **Check for Parallelism**:
   - If a line is parallel to the boundary (i.e., `p[i] == 0`), check whether it lies outside the clipping boundary (`q[i] < 0`). If so, reject the line.

6. **Calculate the Intersection Parameters (`u1` and `u2`)**:
   - For each boundary, calculate the parameter `t = q[i] / p[i]` and update the clipping parameters `u1` and `u2`. These parameters represent the portions of the line that lie within the clipping window.

7. **Clip the Line**:
   - If `u1 < u2`, the line lies inside the clipping window. Calculate the clipped coordinates and draw the clipped line within the window.

8. **Render**:
   - The initial line is drawn before clipping. After pressing the `c` key, the clipping window and the clipped line are displayed.

## Usage

### Compilation

Make sure you have **GLUT** and **OpenGL** libraries installed. Compile the code using the following command:

```bash
g++ -o clipper clipper.cpp -lGL -lGLU -lglut
```

### Running

After compiling, run the program:

```bash
./clipper
```

- A window will appear displaying the original line and the clipping window boundary.
- Press the `c` key to clip the line to the boundary and redraw it.

### Controls
- Press `c` to perform the clipping.
- The black box represents the clipping window, and the black line represents the line being clipped.

## Conclusion

This implementation demonstrates the **Liang-Barsky Line Clipping Algorithm**, which efficiently clips lines against a rectangular window using parametric equations. The algorithm is more computationally efficient compared to the Cohen-Sutherland method, as it reduces the number of intersections calculated and avoids additional floating-point comparisons. The project illustrates how the Liang-Barsky algorithm can be used for real-time line clipping in 2D graphical applications.
