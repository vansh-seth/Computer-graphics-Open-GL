## A1. 
### Basic Differences Between 2D and 3D Transformations:

| **Aspect**            | **2D Transformation**                                 | **3D Transformation**                               |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **Dimensions**        | Operates in 2 dimensions (x, y).                      | Operates in 3 dimensions (x, y, z).                 |
| **Axes**              | Two axes: x and y.                                    | Three axes: x, y, and z.                            |
| **Transformation Types** | Translation, rotation, scaling, and shearing.        | Translation, rotation, scaling, shearing, and perspective projection. |
| **Rotation Axis**     | Rotation occurs around a point (typically the origin).| Rotation can occur around any axis (x, y, or z).    |
| **Matrix Size**       | Uses 3x3 matrices for transformations.                | Uses 4x4 matrices for transformations.              |
| **Application**       | Used for flat objects like images, text, or diagrams. | Used for 3D models, animations, and simulations.    |
| **Perspective**       | No concept of depth or perspective.                   | Includes depth, enabling perspective projections.    |
